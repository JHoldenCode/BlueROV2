This class I made serves to create a Point (or coordinate) based off whatever information you give it. It can work with the location of the robot and information about the sonar like orientation and distance. It works if you just give it the exact points that you want to create a Point object with and it can create a Point around the surface of a hemisphere as well. This class is used in many other programs to create Points.
