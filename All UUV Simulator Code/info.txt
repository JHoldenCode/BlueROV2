This folder contains all of the code that I have created or changed in UUV Sim, unless I missed anything. Most of the programs that I wrote are in uuv_simulator/uuv_control_utils/scripts. All the other folders have example/template launch files or files that contain information for waypoints, disturbances, or worlds. I included info.txt files along with the other files and programs in these folders to try to explain what everything does and why certain files look the way that they do.
